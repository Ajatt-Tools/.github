# Ajatt-Tools

Ajatt-Tools is a collection of software projects that help people learn languages.
The programs and tools gathered here support the
[AJATT philosophy](https://tatsumoto.neocities.org/blog/whats-ajatt).

## Mission

Ajatt-Tools is a joint effort.
The goal of Ajatt-Tools is to collect all libre software for language learning **in one place**.
When everything is in one place, it's easy to find software, and it's easy to help each other.
